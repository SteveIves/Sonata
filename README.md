# Introduction to Sonata

Sonata is an application shell designed to allow Synergy .NET developers to deploy their WPF applications to users in a consistent and consistent way.

Although not limited to hosting applications developed with [Symphony Framework](http://symphonyframework.codeplex.com), a primary use case for Sonata is to use it in conjunction with WPF applications developed using Symphony Framework.

Developing programs for Sonata can be accelerated by using our [NuGet Packages](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=Synergy.Sonata).

Sonata is developed using [Synergy .NET](http://www.synergyde.com/products/development_tools/visual_studio.aspx), so you must have a configured and licensed Synergy .NET environment in place in order to build or run this product.
